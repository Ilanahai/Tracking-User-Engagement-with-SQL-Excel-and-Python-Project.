📊 **User Engagement Analysis using SQL, Excel & Python**
🧠** Project Overview
**
This project focuses on analyzing learner engagement on an online education platform using a data-driven approach. By combining SQL, Excel, and Python, the analysis explores how users interact with the platform, how engagement varies across subscription types, and how learning activity translates into measurable outcomes such as certifications.

The project emphasizes statistical reasoning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling to support business and product decision-making.

🎯 **Objectives**

Analyze user engagement patterns using watch-time data

Compare engagement behavior across different user segments

Measure relationships between learning activity and outcomes

Apply statistical testing to validate engagement changes

Build a predictive model to estimate learning outcomes from user activity

🛠️** Tools & Technologies**

SQL (MySQL) – Data extraction, joins, aggregations

Excel – Statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals

Python – Data cleaning, visualization, and modeling

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

🔄 **Project Workflow**
**Data Extraction & Preparation
**
Raw data was extracted from relational tables using SQL queries. User subscription information was used to classify learners, and engagement metrics were derived from video-watch logs. Certificate data was merged to provide a complete view of learning outcomes.

**Data Cleaning & Exploration
**
Engagement distributions were visualized to understand user behavior patterns. Extreme outliers were removed to ensure robust statistical analysis and realistic modeling.

**Statistical Analysis
**
Key summary statistics were calculated, including mean, variance, and confidence intervals. Two-sample t-tests were performed to determine whether observed engagement differences were statistically significant across user groups.

**Relationship Analysis
**
Correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between learning time and certification outcomes. Visualizations were used to support interpretability.

**Probability & Dependency Analysis
**
Probability concepts were applied to study engagement continuity and dependency across time, providing insights into user retention and behavioral consistency.

**Predictive Modeling
**
A linear regression model was developed to predict certification outcomes based on engagement levels. Model performance was evaluated using train-test splits and R² scores, with visual validation through prediction plots.

📈** Key Insights
**
User engagement distributions are heavily right-skewed

Paid users show more consistent engagement patterns

Statistical testing indicates meaningful engagement differences

Learning time and certifications exhibit a positive relationship

Simple regression models can provide valuable predictive insights
